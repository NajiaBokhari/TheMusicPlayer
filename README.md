# TheMusicPlayer
  iTunes affiliate API is used to develop a simple music player that lets you search by artist and displays the search results on screen. When a song is selected from the list, the song will start to play.  * Each song’s title, artist, album and album art should be displayed.   * When we tap a song, a media player should show up at the bottom of the screen and  start to play the preview for that song. The media player may be something as simple as a toggling play or pause button, however, it should pop-up at the bottom of the screen and on top of the list as shown. All the other controls shown are optional.   * The media player should only show once a song is clicked and should stay on the screen from that point onwards and should be reused for any subsequent song played.   * When a song is being played, you must provide some indication on the list item that the song is being played.   * You can stop playback if a new search is performed, however the preference is for the song to keep playing.   * If you stop playback when a new search is performed, you must hide the media player till a song is selected.   * You can take liberties with the UI, however the major elements as shown in the picture or mentioned above should still be present.
